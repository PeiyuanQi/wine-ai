# Wine Basics

## Wine Types

### Red Wines
Red wines are made from dark-colored grape varieties and derive their color from the grape skins. Common red wine varieties include:
- Cabernet Sauvignon: Full-bodied with high tannins and notes of black currant, cedar, and graphite.
- Merlot: Medium to full-bodied with soft tannins and flavors of plum, cherry, and chocolate.
- Pinot Noir: Light to medium-bodied with low tannins and red fruit flavors like cherry and raspberry.
- Syrah/Shiraz: Bold and spicy with notes of black pepper, dark fruits, and sometimes smoky characteristics.
- Malbec: Medium to full-bodied with soft tannins and notes of blackberry, plum, and cocoa.
- Zinfandel: Bold and fruit-forward with high alcohol content and flavors of jammy berries and spice.

### White Wines
White wines are typically made from "white" (green-skinned) grapes and don't include grape skin in fermentation. Common white wine varieties include:
- Chardonnay: Medium to full-bodied with flavors ranging from apple and lemon to tropical fruits, often with oak influence.
- Sauvignon Blanc: Light-bodied, crisp and acidic with notes of citrus, green apple, and grassy or herbaceous qualities.
- Riesling: Light-bodied, often sweet but can be dry, with high acidity and flavors of apple, pear, and stone fruits.
- Pinot Grigio/Pinot Gris: Light to medium-bodied with notes of citrus, pear, and sometimes floral elements.
- Gewürztraminer: Aromatic with lychee, rose petal, and spice notes.
- Viognier: Full-bodied with perfumed aromas of peach, apricot, and floral notes.

### Rosé Wines
Rosé wines get their pink color from limited contact with red grape skins. They can be made from many different grape varieties and range from dry to sweet:
- Provence Rosé: Typically dry and pale pink with delicate flavors of strawberry, watermelon, and citrus.
- White Zinfandel: Usually sweeter with flavors of berries and melon.
- Tavel: Fuller-bodied dry rosé from the Rhône Valley with robust fruit flavors.

### Sparkling Wines
Sparkling wines contain significant levels of carbon dioxide, making them fizzy:
- Champagne: From the Champagne region of France, made primarily from Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier.
- Prosecco: Italian sparkling wine made from Glera grapes, typically lighter and fruitier than Champagne.
- Cava: Spanish sparkling wine made in the traditional method, similar to Champagne but often at a lower price point.
- Sparkling Rosé: Pink sparkling wine that can be made in various styles.

### Dessert Wines
Dessert wines are sweet and typically served with or as dessert:
- Port: Fortified wine from Portugal, often rich and sweet with flavors of dried fruits and chocolate.
- Sauternes: Sweet white wine from Bordeaux made from grapes affected by "noble rot."
- Ice Wine: Made from grapes that have frozen on the vine, concentrated and very sweet.
- Late Harvest: Made from grapes left on the vine longer to increase sugar content.

## Wine Tasting Basics

### Visual Assessment
- Color and clarity: Observe the wine against a white background
- Viscosity: Swirl the wine to observe "legs" or "tears" forming on the glass
- Bubbles (for sparkling wines): Note the size and persistence of bubbles

### Aroma/Nose
- Primary aromas: From the grape (fruit, floral, herbal)
- Secondary aromas: From winemaking (yeast, dairy)
- Tertiary aromas: From aging (oak, leather, earth, smoke)

### Palate/Taste
- Sweetness: Dry, off-dry, medium-sweet, sweet
- Acidity: Low, medium, high
- Tannin (for red wines): Low, medium, high
- Body: Light, medium, full
- Flavor intensity and characteristics
- Finish: The persistence of flavors after swallowing

### Wine Tasting Vocabulary
- Balanced: All components (acidity, tannin, alcohol, sweetness) in harmony
- Complex: Multiple layers of flavors and aromas
- Length: How long the flavors persist after swallowing
- Crisp: High acidity, refreshing
- Tannic: High in tannins, causing drying sensation
- Oaky: Showing influence from oak aging (vanilla, toast, smoke)
- Corked: Wine spoiled by a contaminated cork (wet cardboard smell)

## Wine Storage and Service

### Storage Conditions
- Temperature: Ideally 55°F (13°C), consistent temperature more important than exact number
- Humidity: 70% ideal to keep corks from drying out
- Light: Minimal exposure, especially to UV light
- Position: Store bottles on their side to keep cork moist (except sparkling wines and screwcap bottles)
- Vibration: Minimal vibration

### Service Temperatures
- Sparkling wines: 40-45°F (4-7°C)
- Light white wines: 45-50°F (7-10°C)
- Full-bodied white wines and light reds: 50-55°F (10-13°C)
- Medium to full-bodied red wines: 60-65°F (16-18°C)
- Dessert wines: Varies by style, typically 45-55°F (7-13°C)

### Glassware
- Red wine glasses: Larger bowl to allow aromas to collect and wine to breathe
- White wine glasses: Smaller bowl to preserve delicate aromas and maintain temperature
- Sparkling wine flutes: Tall and narrow to preserve bubbles
- Dessert wine glasses: Small to accommodate smaller serving sizes

### Decanting
- Purpose: To separate wine from sediment and/or to aerate the wine
- Best for: Older red wines with sediment and young, tannic red wines that need aeration
- Process: Pour slowly and steadily, stopping when sediment reaches the neck of the bottle

## Food and Wine Pairing

### Basic Principles
- Match weight and intensity of food and wine
- Consider acidity, sweetness, and bitterness in both food and wine
- Think about complementary or contrasting flavors
- Regional pairings often work well (Italian wine with Italian food)

### Classic Pairings
- Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled steak
- Chardonnay with lobster or creamy pasta
- Pinot Noir with salmon or mushroom dishes
- Sauvignon Blanc with goat cheese or asparagus
- Port with blue cheese or chocolate desserts
- Champagne with oysters or fried foods
- Riesling with spicy Asian cuisine
- Syrah/Shiraz with barbecue or game meats
